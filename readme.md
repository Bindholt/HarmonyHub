HarmonyHub README!

Dependencies for backend:
Before running the application, you will need to install a few packages on the backend using the node package manager (NPM). 

Packages to install:
Express
cmd line: npm install express

Cors
cmd line: npm install cors

UUIDv4
cmd line: npm install uuidv4

Running the application:
With packages properly installed, you will need to open the frontend and backend folders in two seperate editors (If you open it in the same editor, finnicky refreshes will occur on certain API requests sent from frontend to backend).
Using the terminal, go to: /HarmonyHub/backend
Now, to turn on the server, run the start command-line: npm start

You can now open the frontend index.html with a liveserver, and the application is live and running!
